This is just a quick template for godot game development via the module system on linux, in VSCode.
Things to note:
 - Ctrl + Shift + B will build
 - Ctrl + Alt   + B will build and run godot, opening the ./dot/ folder as a project
 - The ide folder contains godot. Simply doing git pull will update it, changing branches is fine
 - PhysicsTools is included because it's extremely useful
